        this evening, night would be a more appropriate word, a (sort of) friend of mine shares a website of hers to me. (not a friend tbh, i happen to know her) she was asking for something like pick one out and all, but that's not what i want to talk about. it was a simple website, not much of fancy thing, but it was beautiful. it gave me a nostalgia which i was never a part of because i got access to internet in 2018 during jio boom in india and then it took me really long time to get myself out of youtube and explore the world outside of it. she was writing poems on it since 2018. i liked it. see, i am no literature person who knows about the technicality and stuff. i liked it, so i liked it. you can check them out, it will be on the main page or i'll just link it <a href="https://curiosityncreation.blogspot.com/">here</a>.

        it is really interesting, people have so many sides of them which are hidden from you. every discovery gives you a hit of realisation that the person you see might not be the way you percieve that person to be. no, i don't stalk people, but sometimes i do observe them, telling myself how wrong i might be about them. i'll probably write some other blog on it in the future.

        when the social media weren't there, people used to make websites. they used to host it. i am not against social media. it is just another way of social media which normal people are unaware of. my interest to find those hidden websites on the internet grew after i explored neocities. people make websites for free there and damn they are beautiful. they have their own themes. some are deeply depressing. some are creepy. some are happy. some are therapeutic. it is really funny, but bunch of websites were making me feel like i was in future. but probably tons of websites like those won't show up on google/duckduckgo search because they are not search engine optimised. the average internet user should know that there are much much more websites than just 20-30 websites that person visits everytime that person uses the internet.

        what if there was a social media website, instead of a profile, you have your website. and that website won't have any connection with the social media site. the social media site will do the AI magic which will do the work of suggesting new websites to people. the place where you host your website is like a land which the company is renting out to you, a place where you can build stuff.

        internet. a free land. exchange of ideas. a dark place. a light place. a world which is running inside our real world.
