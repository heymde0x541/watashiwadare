        <h2>hello there.</h2>
        <p>This sentient goes by the name heymde.</p>
        <p>Lives in Delhi, India. In college right now, doing B.Tech in Information Technology, 1st year.</p>
        <p>Likes Technology in a weird way. The sentient appears to be quite distant from Technology. Gets confused easily while using Smartphones and other cool stuff (stupid noob), but comfortable with taking things apart, regardless of software or hardware.</p>
        <p>Sentient uses a Thinkpad E14 Gen3 with a Ryzen chip running Fedora Linux. Although this being doesn't tweak the main machine's environment much, but has been observed spending time messing with virtual machines. Also, it appears it has some interest in playing with electronics, has some experience with it.</p>
        <p>Can read and write in C, Python, Bash. Learnt some basic HTML, CSS and JS recently.</p>
        <p>Also, the subject likes to listen to music for relaxation and consumes video contents selectively. It has been observed that after consuming video content the resource usage spikes up, probably due to overthinking.</p>
        <p>It is found that surprisingly its music taste varies by a lot with mood, sentient even spent the saved money on new IEMs. Although it listens to tons of genre in music, but it has been observed that recently the playtimes of RnB, Progressive Post Rock, 80s Synthwave, Dream Pop, City Pop, Western Classical Music, Experimental Music has increased.</p>
        <p>Its political opinions are generally neutral (and are becoming more and more neutral). Politically inclined towards left, I'm not sure, it's hard to determine because the subject tends to overexplain everything. It appears that the subject has not reached enough optimal level of intelligence to form opinions.</p>
        <p>Minimal human interaction, it appears it rather spends time talking to itself. Also, it has been observed that the subject is quite paranoid of its surroundings.</p>
        <p>Bugs : Many; caution - you are on your own.</p>
